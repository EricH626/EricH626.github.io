				<p class="last">Antonio's Taqueria has been serving the community for over 40 years and is the go to place for authentic Mexican cuisine. Never franchising and always staying true to our standards of quality has ensured that our status of the best Mexican Restaurant in Los Angeles Metro Area is secure. 40 years ago our founder, Antonio Hernandez, started a taco cart business. And the quality of his food blossomed his business into a restaurant that feeds hundreds of people a day. Today we continue his vision of Mexican excellence with our great food and service!</p>
